# Credit Risk Classification

This notebook will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of future borrowers. Testing two different models, it will see if either has a better ability to detect those that might default on their loans. A Report will be included to better explain the results from this notebook.

## Technologies

This project utilizes a lot of different add ons, please make sure you have all these and they are up to date:

* [JupyterLab 3.4.4](https://jupyter.org/) - For the notebook creation and running of the code.

* [pandas 1.4.3](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/README.md) - For reading the csv files and other operations.

* [numpy](https://https://numpy.org/) - Loaded in, used in a few the operations...maybe?

* [scikit-learn v1.1.1](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - For running models and other reports.

* [PyDotPlus v2.0.2](https://pydotplus.readthedocs.io/) - To plot decision trees.

* [imbalance-learn v0.9.1](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - For Classification Report and Oversampling option.

## Usage

To access the credit risk notebook, please begin by typing jupyter lab in your terminal. 

```python
jupyter lab
```

Next, find the folder with the notebook(credit_risk_resampling.ipynb) and double click it to open the notebook in a new launcher. Then, begin running through each section of the application to get the appropriate data.

Once in the notebook it will take you through a step-by-step process as it Collects the Data, Prepares the Data, and Analyzes the Data.
You will be granted reports along the way to help better understand the data, but a report will be included with this to help better understand the information.

We do believe everything is thoroughly explained in the notebook, but please let us know if you have any further questions.

We have also included a Report (Report-CreditRisk.md) that further explains the information, please review the report before submitting any questions.
